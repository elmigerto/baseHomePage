# Background Images

- [x] Display random image from the current section's `files` folder
- [x] Position image behind all content using `-z-10`
- [x] Fill almost the entire viewport with `h-[90vh] w-[90vw]`
- [x] Scroll down moves image to the right; scroll up moves it left

The feature is implemented via the `ScrollingImage` component.
