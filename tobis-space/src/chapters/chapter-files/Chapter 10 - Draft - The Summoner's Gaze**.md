**Chapter 10: The Summoner's Gaze**

He stepped into the street, his stomach growling from hunger that had settled deep and stubborn, like a second heartbeat. The market bristled with curiosities he'd never tasted, never dared to name. On the market, he saw a simple rack displaying fruits. A woman sliced some into bowls, assembling what looked like fruit salad. One fruit caught his eye—blue, egg-shaped.

"Dragon fruit? Rare stuff," the woman said, slicing one open without looking up. "Came in with a dusty merchant. Grows on spiky trees, or so they claim. Half a coin for you—if you're brave enough to try it."

They came in all colors, and this was cheaper than what he’d paid at the last market. He took the fruit and bit into it. The skin was fragrant, almost like sweet berries. But the inside—white with black seeds—was bland, almost tasteless. A beautiful lie. He was a bit disappointed. Still, he liked it.

He walked on. The houses varied: some were wood-framed, others with white plaster walls, all grimy. Broken tiles, torn paper, collapsed gutters. Trash piled in alleys. This was still the outskirts. The scent of shit and urine clung to every corner.

The air, once fresh on the farm, now draped over the city like a sickly green fog. Smells had no color, but to him, the stench was always green.

Two children fought over a shattered toy. A madman screamed about dragons destroying everything. He passed a building so broken it looked melted—only a beggar sat in its shadow.

Then, on a broad square, a summoner walked past.

White robe. Gold and blue embroidery. Gleaming shoes.

He looked like a creature from another world. The contrast was painful. Everyone else wore plain, dirt-stained brown—some never with a single ornament in their life.

People stepped aside. Heads dipped. Respect—or fear.

_That’s what power feels like,_ Varan thought. _Just some clothes, and the world bows to you._

He hated it. The unfairness. Born rich—you had a shot. Born poor—you grovelled. Summoners served the rich. Protected them. Were them.

What did he know of wealth? He’d only seen nobles from afar. Rare visitors to the farm. But here, in the city, the difference between castes was blinding.

Then it stirred again—the pounding, the pressure, like distant thunder echoing from inside his ribs.

Inside his chest, the blue creature stirred—like a prisoner pacing its cell, testing the walls. Varan placed his hand on his chest. Tried to feel it. Focus.

And then—eyes on him.

He looked up.

The summoner.

They locked eyes. The man wasn’t just passing now. He was watching. Not curious. Not confused. Challenging.

Testing.

Varan didn’t look away. Couldn’t. The summoner’s gaze wasn’t aggressive. It was deeper. Stranger. Like he wasn’t seeing Varan’s face—but something inside him. A mark. A signal.

Time slowed. The market faded. Voices vanished. His chest burned—not pain, not warmth, but something energetic. Alive.

He wanted to scratch it, break the link, but he was frozen. Exposed. It felt like the whole square was empty but for the two of them.

Then it ended.

The summoner looked away. Kept walking. Didn’t break stride.

Varan stood in silence, breath shaky.

Who was that man? Why him?

Had he seen something?

His chest still tingled. He felt like he’d been tagged. Not attacked—but noticed. And he didn’t know whether that was a blessing or a threat.

A child approached him. "Give me a coin, please. For food."

Varan looked down, uncertain. His chest still tingled faintly, the aftershock of the summoner's gaze lingering in his body. "I don’t have much myself."

He barely glanced away, and suddenly there were three more children behind him, hands darting for his bag.

His body snapped to alert. "Hush."

They scattered. Fast. No shame. Just habit.

People nearby had barely reacted. This was normal.

He checked his belt. Nothing taken.

He kept walking. Toward the edge of the city. Past the last carts and smoke and shouting.

A small river curved out into the wild. Grass grew thick on both sides. Hills rolled soft, dotted with flowers. The sky was finally open again.

That’s when he saw her.

She stood on the bank, drawing water with a bucket. White linen clothes. Hair tied at the crown, the rest loose. No jewelry. She didn’t need any. Her presence alone was complete.

It was her.

The woman from the house. The one from the theft. The one who saw him.

He stopped.

She hadn’t noticed him. Not yet. He stayed still, watching.

Could he approach? Should he? Had the theft been discovered? 

The sun, newly emerged from behind clouds, struck the water’s surface—turning it to light. Her outline shimmered, obscured.

And then—she turned. Walked away. Up a hill. No glance back.

Gone.

He stepped toward the place she’d stood. A patch of grass, slightly pressed.

Something glinted.

A silver bracelet lay half-hidden in the blades.

She must have dropped it.

No one around.

Maybe now, he could try.

He picked up the bracelet, turned it in his fingers, then slipped it quietly into his pocket.  
Then he placed his hand on his chest.

Time to summon the blue one.
