### **Chapter 2: The Weight of Chains**

The world was too bright.

He winced as sunlight filtered through the canopy, burning into his skull like fire. His body ached, limbs stiff as if they had turned to stone overnight. The pain in his leg pulsed with every movement, but worse was the exhaustion—deep, bone-heavy, as if he had fought for days instead of hours.

He was alive. That much was a miracle.

He sat up, pressing a hand against his ribs. His father had always warned him about the forest at night. *Never sleep under the trees, boy. Night belongs to the creatures.* But last night, the creatures had stayed away. He had been lucky. Or maybe something had scared them off.

His thoughts flickered to his father, and a pang of guilt twisted inside him. *What will happen to him?* He hadn’t seen him when he ran. Hadn’t dared look back. His father had been a cunning man, strong and sharp-witted, the kind of man who could have carved a different fate if the world were fair. But it wasn’t. No matter how intelligent, how good-looking, how full of promise, his father had ended up a slave. And now, he was the father of a fugitive.

The pain in his leg dragged him back to reality. He pushed the thoughts away. **Survive first. Mourn later.**

Gritting his teeth, he pulled up his torn pant leg. A deep gash streaked along his calf, dried blood caking the fabric. He must have gotten it in the chaos of the night. Running like that on an open wound was foolish. He would have to manage.

His stomach growled. Food.

The memory of last night came rushing back—the campfire, the soldiers, the beast. He turned his head slowly. The clearing was still there, but the fire had long since burned out. Scattered bodies lay where they had fallen, the ground blackened with blood. The monster’s corpse was a twisted thing, its form unnatural even in death.

He forced himself to his feet and limped toward the bodies. He needed supplies. He couldn’t walk through the woods looking like a runaway slave. His tattered brown clothes marked him as property, a dead man if anyone recognized him. He stripped one of the fallen soldiers, taking a tunic, a belt, and a dagger. The armor was too heavy—it would hinder his flight, slow him down, and make survival troublesome in the forest—but the boots fit well enough, though they rubbed uncomfortably against his wound.

He felt no pity for them. They would have killed him without hesitation.

Something caught his eye. A shimmer, a glint of blue.

His breath hitched as he turned back toward the monster’s body. The glow came from beneath its mangled chest, pulsing softly like a dying ember. He stepped closer, hesitating, his heart hammering in his chest.

His fingers brushed against something smooth. He grasped it, pulling it free. A perfectly round stone, cool to the touch, swirling with veins of deep, sapphire blue.

An egg.

He sucked in a sharp breath. He had heard of this. When a powerful creature died, it sometimes left behind an egg—an echo of its existence, something that could be used to summon it back. Only trained summoners knew how to wield them, how to bond with the creatures inside. But he wasn’t a summoner. He had no idea what to do with it.

And yet, he couldn’t leave it behind.

He slipped it into the bag he had taken from one of the soldiers and tightened the straps. He had no plan, no idea where to go, but he would figure it out. He had to.

His stomach growled again, louder this time. He turned his gaze back to the remains of the campfire. There had been food last night. He had smelled it.

He limped toward the charred logs, scanning the ground. The fire was cold, but there was still some meat left on the side. It smelled strange—metallic, with a deep, woody spice—but hunger drove him forward. He reached for it, ready to tear off a piece—

Then he froze.

The smell wasn’t from the meat.

A wave of dread rolled over him, seizing his chest in a vice. He had heard of this scent before—not in the farm, not in the forest, but in stories. In legends whispered by those who claimed to have seen a red dragon and lived to tell of it.

A red dragon.

The scent clung to the air, thick and unmistakable. He barely breathed, his body locked in place. No wonder the creatures had left him alone. No wonder the forest had been so silent. A dragon had passed through. And it wasn’t far.

His grip tightened on the dagger at his waist. Not that it would help him if he was right.

He swallowed hard, glancing around the clearing. **I need to move. Now.**
