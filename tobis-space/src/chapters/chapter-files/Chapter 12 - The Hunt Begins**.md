**Chapter 12: The Hunt Begins**

It was already noon when Varan made his way back. The sun hung low, casting the Blue City in a warm orange hue. The rooftops gleamed like copper plates. Despite the beauty, his thoughts were tangled. The summoning. Mira. Had he messed it up? He could have said something different. Anything else. Maybe then she wouldn't have told him not to come.

But she had seen him during the theft. That changed everything. If they had met under different circumstances... maybe she would have smiled. Maybe they wouldn't be strangers with too much unsaid between them. Was she protecting him? Was someone already looking for him? And had she really dropped the bracelet—or left it, knowing he'd find it?

He nearly walked straight into a towering man in the crowd.

"Watch where you're going, little one!" the man growled.

Varan stepped back quickly. "I'm sorry."

People were looking now. Not what he needed.

The man’s clothes were rough, his face marked by sun and sweat. A laborer, by the look of him—and not one Varan wanted trouble with. As the man turned to leave, Varan caught something at the edge of his vision. A summoner. Standing in the alley. Watching him.

Varan turned toward him, but the figure was already gone.

The laborer grunted, unimpressed, and moved on. The moment passed. The street went back to its chatter. Varan faded into the crowd again. He checked his bag. Everything still there. No coin lost. Just nerves.

That evening, he lay on his bed, restless. Mira’s face lingered in his mind. So did her words. So did her scent.

And the hunt. It loomed like a shadow.

Was he ready? Would Mark trick him again? He felt better knowing the Serpentine Princess was with him now—hidden, silent. She could be his last resort. He wouldn’t reveal her yet. Not unless he had to. He gave her a name that night, lying in the dark: **Serpentine Princess**.

Sleep came late and uneasy, filled with broken dreams of fire, claws, and betrayal. Mira laughing with Mark. Mark walking away while Varan bled in the forest.

"Prepare your weapons," Mark said.

Morning in the misted forest. They moved in silence, five of them: Mark, Varan, Leon, the ranger, and a summoner.

The trees were thick, wet with dew, and the sky above them hidden. Light came down in threads. Every snapped twig echoed like a threat.

Mark wore a mismatched armor set—a golden breastplate, silver bracelets, and red trousers. Elegant, but cobbled together. A scavenger’s trophy collection. His rose-hilted sword looked more ceremonial than deadly, but Varan wasn’t sure. Mark had survived long enough.

Leon, also new, walked near him, wearing heavy armor and gripping his shield too tightly. Varan, similarly armored, felt the weight of his gear with each step. The metal pulled on his shoulders, the shield already making his forearm ache. Could he really fight in this?

The ranger argued often with Mark, muttering curses under his breath. He had a curved bow and sharp eyes but hadn’t proven much yet.

The summoner was the oddest of them—light blue robes, no flair, clumsy gait. But he was the one to protect. He carried two red summons today—agile and fierce. That alone made him their strongest asset, at least for now.

Red was currently the dominant color. Mark hadn’t said how long that would last.

Then—movement.

Rustling leaves. A branch snapping. All heads turned.

"Above!" Mark shouted.

From the sky, it came. A red-winged beast descended like a falling star, arms wreathed in flame. An oversized bat—teeth long and yellow, fire leaking from its joints.

A firebolt streaked toward Varan.

He raised his shield just in time. Heat seared across his forearm, burning the edge of his hair. For a moment, everything was fire and roaring.

Then—an impact.

The beast crashed into the earth beside them. It shrieked, arrows lodged in its flank. The ranger had struck. Two clean hits.

A red imp and a wolf burst from the summoner’s body, hurling themselves at the beast.

Leon moved to shield the others. Mark charged, slashing one of the flaming arms, then backed off quickly.

"Run!" Mark barked.

The wolf and the imp tangled with the bat-creature, claws on flame. The ranger fired more arrows, retreating. The summoner ran. Leon hesitated, then followed.

Varan ran, too. Mark passed him, fast.

Behind them, the forest echoed with screeches and growls. Then—a high-pitched whimper. The wolf. Silence followed.

They stopped beneath thick underbrush. The summoner crouched low, panting. The others followed suit.

Flames flickered in the distance. Wings flapped. Shadows moved.

Stillness returned.

Bugs crawled over Varan’s leg. He stayed still, sweat dripping down his back. The danger passed - Varan had survived his first real battle.
