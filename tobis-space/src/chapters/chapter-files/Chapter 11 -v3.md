**Chapter 11: The River and the Summon**

He looked into the river. The water drifted downstream in a slow but steady rhythm, making a constant noise that seemed to absorb even the birdsong. He breathed in—breathed out. Closed his eyes. Placed his hand on his chest and tried to look inward.

Darkness.

He floated in an infinite black space, like an omniscient being adrift in his own body. Far off, something shimmered—a flicker of blue, the creature, gliding through the void like a fish in a pond.

He reached for it with his mind, forming a transparent hand in the darkness. But each time he tried to grasp it, it slipped away like wet silk. This wasn’t working. Too quick. Too evasive. Instead, he shaped a sphere, closing it gently around the creature.

Caught.

He felt its presence. It turned into light. Power surged into him. The creature’s body surrounded him like a transparent aura. It was too much. He pushed his hands forward, picturing her in front of him.

A burst of light flowed from his chest—and there she was.

The blue serpent materialized before him.

He’d done it.

Joy rose in him, breathless and light—until she moved. Then leapt. And with a splash, disappeared into the river.

“What?” He blinked, dumbfounded. “Come back!”

No reaction.

A strange emptiness opened inside him. As if something had been stolen. He scanned the shimmering water—stones, shadows, light dancing—but there was nothing. The river whispered in steady rhythm, like nothing had happened. He stood alone, frustrated.

Then—movement.

Just a meter in front of him, the blue creature burst from the water. He dodged just in time. She landed behind him, hissing low.

She wasn’t friendly.

The serpent turned. Her finned head flared like a crown. Her perfect reptilian skin shimmered in blue gradients: a light belly, darker back, woven in wave-like patterns. Beautiful—elegant—but deadly. Even her face, reptilian and strange, had a hint of humanity beneath its symmetry.

She launched again.

“Stop!” he cried, stepping back.

In midair, something changed.

Her eyes lost their gleam. Her mouth closed. She was still coming, but now—calm.

She landed on him, her body crashing into his, knocking him flat.

Her cold, wet weight covered him. His hands sank into her slick skin. A faint, sweet scent—fishlike, but not unpleasant—clung to her. No aggression. Just presence. He exhaled hard. His chest still pounded, but she lay still.

Then—someone else.

He twisted, brushed the serpentine tail aside.

She stood there. Just a few meters away. Silent. Watching.


He scrambled out from beneath the creature, wiping his wet hands on his clothes. The serpent sat beside him now, alert but peaceful, like a dog waiting for its master.

“Hi,” he said. His voice was a bit too loud. “I guess I made an interesting performance.”

The woman tilted her head, gaze cool. Her eyes flicked from him to the creature and back again. Then, finally, she spoke.

“Not something you see every day.” A pause. “Was that... intentional?”

He flushed. “First time summoning her. Didn’t go exactly to plan.”

“You stopped her in time. Could’ve been a messy end otherwise.”

He gave a crooked smile. “Would’ve ruined the scenery.”

“I don’t like red and green together anyway,” she said dryly.

He gave a crooked smile. “Did you maybe drop this?” He reached into his bag and pulled out the silver bracelet. It was still undamaged, though he wiped it a bit more with his palm.

She stepped closer. “Where’d you find it?”

“By the river. Thought it might be yours.”

She took it. Their hands brushed. Her white linen sleeve fluttered with the breeze. A scent of lavender caught in the air.

“It’s beautiful,” he said. “Does it have a meaning?”

“A gift from my mother.”

He turned it over. Etched into the band— a rat engulfed in flames.

His breath caught.

The same mark as on his father’s dagger.

She must be from the Red Kingdom.

He hesitated. “It’s a strong symbol.”

She didn’t answer. Just nodded, then fastened the bracelet around her wrist.

“What’s your name?”

“Mira.”

“I’m Varan.”

They looked at each other for a moment too long.

“I will go,” she said, eyes lingering on him a moment longer. “Interesting performance. Don't let the next one eat you.”

“Where will you be tomorrow?”

She hesitated. Looked away.

“I have business at the fruit market tomorrow. - Don’t come.”

He watched her walk away. Her steps light, her figure vanishing behind the hill.

The blue creature nuzzled his leg gently, then turned to gaze after her too.
