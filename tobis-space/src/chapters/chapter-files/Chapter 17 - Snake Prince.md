**Chapter 17: Snake Prince**

Leon and Varan pushed through the crowd toward the beginner's arena. It was less packed than the others—maybe twenty spectators stood around a hexagonal ring made of crude wooden pillars and a sagging rope. The people here were younger, the energy more restless. Less glory, less gold. But also less risk.

In the ring, an ant-like summon squared off against a dog with a fishlike head. Their movements were cautious, searching for openings—but too hesitant. The thick tension that hung in the air like a thunderstorm in the higher arenas was here barely a warm breeze. These fighters didn’t know what it meant to fight for survival. A mistake.

"If you fight, you have to be all in—ready to kill your opponent the moment the battle starts. No hesitation. And a plan. Always a plan," Varan thought.

He analyzed their movements. Fighting could bring attention—and danger. But he needed a foothold. Reputation. A way to make his stand in this city. Away from his slave life. Something to show Mira—if he ever saw her again.

“Hey, you two!” a man called, stepping toward them. Bald on top, hair only on the sides, and a broad, toothy grin. He looked to be in his fifties and had the round, flushed face of someone who laughed often. “New here? Want to register? Got a summon?”

“Just watching,” Leon said. “How are today’s fights going?”

The man shrugged. “A few signups. Mostly kids flailing around. Still, it’s good practice. Anyone can join. And if you like betting...” He leaned in with a wink. “I’ll give double payout if you put your coin on the ant. Can’t say the same for the fish-dog.”

Leon grinned. “What do you think, Varan? Will the ant win?”

“Don’t bet so fast,” Varan said flatly.

“He looks strong, though. And doubling our coins sounds nice.”

The man chimed in again. “Tell you what. You’re new—I like that. Fresh eyes. Bet now and I’ll give you three times the payout if the ant wins.”

Leon’s eyes lit up. “Three times? Alright, can’t pass that up. I’ll go for the ant.” He handed over a coin.

The man smiled wide. “May the summons favor you.”

They turned their attention back to the ring. The ant lashed forward. Leon leaned in, nearly shouting.

“Come on! Take him down!”

But the excitement faded quickly. A few minutes later, the ant lay sprawled on the ground, vanishing in a shimmer of light as it returned to its summoner.

“Sorry about your luck,” the bald man said kindly. “Maybe next round?”

Leon grimaced. “Ah, thought I could win. Bad for the coin. No, not today.”

Varan leaned close. “Leon—can you keep a secret?”

Leon raised a brow. “Of course.”

Varan stepped toward the bald man. “If I register, when will my fight be? And what do you need from me?”

Leon stared. “Varan?”

“One more match before your turn,” the man said. “Just register. Beginners only—summons must be one-egg strength or less. No exceptions.”

“Register me as Snake Prince. Will that work?”

“The name’s up to you,” the man said with a shrug. “Half a coin to register. Win and you get a coin.”

Varan handed him half a coin. “I’m in.”

The next match began. A green frog the size of a dog faced off against an oversized blue rat, its skin glossy like a fish. Varan watched closely. The rat was water-aligned—stronger, at least in theory. Odds were in its favor. But the frog’s summoner didn’t seem clueless. A tall, self-assured man, maybe twenty, with an easy posture and watchful eyes. He wore fine clothes with two white stars and a crescent moon stitched into the fabric—likely a symbol of some noble house or faction. Varan had seen emblems like that on the farm. People treated them with respect.

Usually, people with money or a faction behind them got trained properly. That was the biggest difference money made—less bruises, more tutors. He’d learned through blood and bruises. They learned with teachers and scrolls.

At the signal, the rat charged. The noble boy stood still, almost bored, but his posture was tense. The frog didn’t move. It waited.

“What’s his plan?” Varan thought. “What is that frog hiding?”

The rat bared its fangs and lunged for the frog’s legs. But before it reached them, the frog leapt. In midair, its long tongue snapped downward—lightning-fast—striking the rat's neck with pinpoint precision. Then the frog landed softly, meters away, not even turning back.

The rat stumbled. Blue blood bubbled from its throat. It tried to turn, staggering. Took a few steps. Then collapsed. One final twitch from its paw—and the life left it.

A glowing blue shimmer rose and returned to its summoner.

It happened so fast, most of the crowd had missed the key moment.

There was silence. Shock. Then whispers.

Nature creatures weren’t supposed to be strong right now. The bets had leaned heavily toward the rat. The rat’s summoner stood frozen, trembling. The frog’s summoner smiled faintly. And the bald man laughed.

“So they were all tricked,” Varan thought. “False odds. Rigged bets.”

A few in the crowd still smiled—probably those who already knew how this place worked.

The winner was announced. The tension broke. People shouted, argued, laughed. Some were angry. Others cheered. “Frog Star!” someone yelled, and others took up the chant. Coins changed hands.

Leon muttered, “That was fast… way too fast.”

After a short break and clean-up, the bald man stepped into the ring.

“In the next duel,” he called, “we will see the Snake Prince versus Peter’s Shadow!”

Varan stepped onto one side of the arena. Opposite him stood a thin girl, maybe sixteen. She looked fragile—but her gaze was sharp and calculating.

“At least no fancy dress,” Varan thought. “But still… this won’t be easy.”

He summoned the Serpentine Princess. A few people gasped at her beauty and elegance.

The girl summoned a red-scaled humanoid—bipedal, with lizard features and clawed hands and feet.

Leon watched from the side, nervous.

Bets were placed.

The battle was about to begin.
