### **Chapter 6: The Offer**

Varan stared at the man before him—the same man who had offered help, then stripped him of every coin, and now, with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes, offered help again.

He hated being played. Hated the way Mark treated people like tools—take what you want, give nothing back. But he wasn’t angry, not truly. Men like Mark were everywhere, scraping to survive. It was the way of the world.

Still, a man who betrayed you once was just as likely to do it again.

Varan stayed still, mind sharp, weighing every word, every movement. Mark’s offer could be real, or just another step in the trap. Either way, he had to stay alert, reflect on everything, measure every choice. Trust nothing.

Revenge stirred faintly in his chest—the farm, the overseers. Maybe, just maybe, joining these cutthroats would give him a chance to strike back someday. And... he was curious. Curious what this life would offer, what doors it might open—or slam shut.

Mark wasn’t a killer without reason. That much Varan sensed. If he refused, he’d likely be fine—maybe roughed up, maybe not. But if he pushed too hard, gambled too far, Mark might change his mind.

And would he ever be safe if he refused? Could he be safe if he accepted?

His fingers tensed. The three men still watched, silent, waiting for him to break.

Varan stood tall and said coldly, “You steal from me, and now you offer a hand? Sounds like another trap.”

Mark’s grin widened, more amused than insulted. “I see you’re not a fool. Good. I like that.” He reached down, picked up the bag of coins, and dug inside. Then he flicked a single coin toward Varan, who caught it in the air.

“I’ll give you your money back—and match it when you finish a task for us. Call it a first step, a little trust between us.”

Varan’s eyes narrowed. “What kind of task?”

“You’ll learn more when you accept. But I promise, nothing worse than you'd expect from thieves.” Mark’s voice was easy, smooth, like they were discussing the weather. “Besides, this city’s a dangerous place. Alone, you’re a walking target. With us? One less knife at your back.”

He stepped closer, voice dropping low. “I don’t make this offer to everyone.”

Varan hesitated, then nodded. “I was looking for work anyway.”

“I knew you were a smart one.” Mark’s voice was warm now, almost friendly. He tossed the coin pouch back to one of the other men, who tucked it away without comment.

“You can sleep tonight at the Fried Chicken—an inn, few streets off the square with that ugly grey statue of our emperor. Show the coin, say I sent you. They’ll give you a room.”

He started to turn, then paused. “Tomorrow, you earn your place. There’s a diamond we want—locked away in one of the finer houses nearby. You’ll get instructions at the inn.”

Varan’s brow furrowed. “Why me?”

Mark’s smile returned. “Because we’re all known in that district. Guards see us, they shut doors. You? You’re new. Clean. If things go wrong, we can deny you. You’re not one of us—yet.”

“And after?”

“They’ll tell you at the inn. If you manage... maybe next time we meet, it’s as brothers.”

Mark turned, the others following, laughing quietly as they vanished into the shadows of the street.

Varan stood alone, the coin warm in his palm. His first job, thrust on him in a back alley, under threat and promise. He didn’t know what tomorrow would bring.

But he was starting to understand this city—and the cost of survival.

And he’d survive. Whatever it took.
