After dinner, they wandered back into the city.

"Still a few hours till dark," Leon said, not looking at Varan.

The sun had dipped below the horizon, but the city still glowed with the amber haze of a summer evening. Nights here stretched long—only a few hours of true darkness. The air felt warm, almost still. A few high clouds caught the last light. Around them, the streets had shifted. The workday was done. Laughter rose from alleys and doorsteps. People gathered in groups—eating, drinking, trading jokes and rumors, bargaining over roasted meat or crusted bread.

Leon nudged him. "Here it is! Trust me, it's more fun than it looks—and if I’m lucky, I might finally win back those coins I lost betting on a goose fight." He grinned, clearly amused with himself.

They ducked into a narrow alley between two buildings. The passage opened into a wide square, ringed by twenty worn-down houses and tenement blocks. The cobbles were uneven, some stained, some cracked. Once a market, maybe. Most carts were gone now, and those that remained sold skewered meat or lukewarm ale. The place had changed—remade in the image of violence.

Arenas. Three of them.

People crowded in clusters, their attention divided between three separate rings. Makeshift fences marked each battlefield.

Leon pointed. "Beginner arena’s over there. Middle one’s for those who’ve seen a few fights. And that—" he gestured toward the far side, where the crowd was densest, "—that’s for the real ones. You’ll know it when you see it."

Varan nodded. His eyes followed the flow of people.

"I think the Lost Wanderer fights today," Leon said, eyes scanning the crowd. "He’s got this weird bug-thing—like a giant ant or something. People say it moves like smoke and hits like a blade. Not sure how true that is, but it sounds nasty."

They pushed their way toward the largest arena. The crowd was thick—sweaty backs, sharp elbows, shouting voices—but eventually, they reached the front.

Wooden bars framed a rough circle in the center of the square, forming a crude fence. Inside, two creatures circled one another. One was orange, simian in shape, with an extra set of wiry arms. The other—a white bull—was massive. A single horn jutted from its forehead, and coarse black hair hung in ropes from its lower body. Its skin was streaked with bulging black veins. Blood already streaked its side. One of the ape’s four arms dangled limp.

Varan leaned forward, eyes scanning the perimeter. No hoods. No flashy cloaks. Just two figures opposite each other, each surrounded by a small bubble of space. The crowd gave them room—too much respect to be coincidence. Summoners.

The bull charged without warning.

A low rumble vibrated through the wooden bars as its hooves struck dirt. The ape darted to the side, barely escaping. It landed a glancing hit on the bull’s ribs—too soft to matter. Then it jumped, aiming to latch onto the bull’s back, but the beast was already moving.

Fast. Too fast for something that size.

It wheeled around mid-run, kicked off the ground, and came charging again, lower, harder. The ape hesitated. Left? Right? It shifted its weight, feinted one way, tried to dodge the other.

But the bull didn’t fall for it.

It adjusted mid-run, locked in, and slammed into the ape. Not the horn—just sheer mass. A wall of muscle and momentum.

The ape was flung aside like a broken doll. It crashed into the dirt, limbs sprawled. Groans echoed through the crowd, followed by a sharp cheer.

Varan’s hand gripped the bar. He wasn’t sure when he’d leaned in that far.

The bull slowed, then turned with eerie calm. Its nostrils flared. It looked down at the ape, who was crawling back, face contorted with pain and panic.

Still watching. Still measuring.

Varan’s stomach twisted. There was something chilling in that pause. Like the bull wasn’t just reacting—it was thinking. Hunting.

It charged again, horn lowered.

The ape flinched, tried to scramble back—too slow. Too wounded. But just before the horn struck, something shifted. The fear in the ape’s eyes vanished. His body tensed. He rolled backward, braced his feet, and kicked at the bull’s chest in a desperate attempt to redirect it.

For a heartbeat, Varan thought it might work.

But it didn’t.

The bull was too heavy, too fast. It barreled through the strike as if the ape hadn’t resisted at all. The smaller beast tumbled, then hit the dirt hard. The bull was on him a second later.

And then it was over.

"I would've bet on the orange ape," Leon said, shaking his head with a crooked smile. "He looked scrappy enough. But the bull—damn, that thing just doesn’t stop. I’d rather wrestle a bear than outrun that."

"Maybe your fairy wouldn’t be much help here," Varan said, half-smirking.

Leon gave him a look. But before he could answer, someone touched Varan’s shoulder.

An old woman. Ragged shawl. Pale eyes.

"You carry strong blue energy," she said softly. "You could win. You might win."

Varan froze. Did she feel it? Did she know?

She smiled. "Some food, perhaps? For an old woman."

He blinked, reached for his pocket—but she was already gone.

Leon raised an eyebrow. "You alright? You were staring at nothing."

"Yeah. I’m fine," Varan said, shaking it off. But his thoughts lingered. That look. That certainty.

He turned back to the arena.

"Leon," he said. "Where did you say the beginners arena was again?"
