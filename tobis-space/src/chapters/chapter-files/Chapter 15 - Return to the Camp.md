**Chapter 15: Return to the Camp**

The walk home was uneventful. No monster attacks. It felt much shorter than the way there. Mark also knew a shortcut, cutting their travel time significantly.

They arrived at the bandits' camp around noon. Passing through a crooked doorway, they entered a small courtyard surrounded by weathered houses. Men trained with bows and swords; others sat at tables, arguing over crumpled maps and papers. In one corner, a few fighters trained against summoned creatures.

Varan paused to watch. A black, beetle-like summon, about the size of a dog, charged three bandits. One threw a net over it; another hacked at its legs; the third got pushed down by its horned head. Summons healed. People didn't. That was the difference.

Then he felt it—a stirring inside him. The blue serpentine princess. Her presence flared, vivid and strong, sending a wave of cold energy into his limbs. Was this how the color shift felt? A surge of power tied to the world's shifting tides?

He glanced quickly at the summoner. No reaction—except a fleeting look thrown back at him. Irritated, suspicious.

Had he given something away?

Not yet. He would keep his summon hidden for as long as he could. Better to let others guess. Better not to reveal your strength—or your weakness.

Mark tossed him a few coins. "Get some food at the cook's table. Then head back to your inn. We'll send word when the next task comes."

Mark, the summoner, and the archer disappeared into one of the buildings, leaving Varan and Leon alone.

The smell of smoke and salted broth wafted through the courtyard. A squat, round man—Berto, by the looks of it—stood by a great pot, stirring with a massive ladle.

Varan’s stomach growled. He hadn't eaten since morning. Anything would do.

Leon caught up beside him. "I'm dying of hunger. The broth isn't as bad as it looks. Berto knows how to cook," he said with a grin.

Varan just nodded, still cautious around new faces.

"A week ago, I was still sleeping at the inn," Leon continued. "After a few missions, they gave me a room here. Have to do cleaning work to stay. It's better here though. They train you."

"Where did they find you?" Varan asked, curious.

Leon chuckled. "Tried to steal a goat. Managed to grab it. But when I tried selling it to Mark, he took me in. You probably know how he recruits."

"I do."

They each received a steaming bowl of broth from Berto.

"How was the hunt? Any good prey?" Berto asked, squinting at them.

"A green one. Green deer. Scary beasts. Plus a flying red imp. Nearly got cooked alive," Leon said, flashing a bruised grin.

"Could use some fried meat for the stew," Berto joked. "Adds flavor."

"Not over my body," Leon said, laughing.

"A whole body would taste even better," Berto teased.

"Did you maybe see the green dragon?" Berto added with a wink. "People say its eyes shine like emeralds. Skin full of thorns."

"Luckily not," Leon said. "Don't like thorns anyway. Rip up your clothes."

"You don't have much to ruin anyway," Berto shot back.

They took their bowls to a nearby table.

Varan leaned in, voice low. "Hey, Leon. Know anything about how summons are made?"

"Not much more than the basics. You need an egg—and a matching scroll. Some summons need one egg, some need more. Stronger summons cost more." He shrugged. "Mark sometimes sells scrolls—if you can pay."

"Ever thought about becoming a summoner yourself?" Varan asked.

Leon laughed. "Of course. But how does a guy like me find an egg? Maybe after a few good raids, Mark will hand one over. Then I won't be powerless anymore. Imagine—a fire jin. Or a water horse. Or a beautiful mermaid."

"I'd go for an ogre," Varan said.

Leon stared at him. "An ogre? Not even a pretty fairy?"

Varan smiled faintly. "An ogre could build me a house. Help with farm work. Protect my land. I'd rather have a human by my side than a summon."

He thought of Mira—and her strange, distant smile.

Leon nodded. "Makes sense."

"There are summoning battles every day here," Leon added. "Not exactly legal, but they draw a crowd. Want to watch one later?"

"Why not," Varan said. Maybe he could learn more.
