# 🐉 **The Dragon’s Tweak: A Game of Strategic Summoning**

In a fractured realm of floating hexes and flickering magic, only the cunning will survive — and only one will tame the Dragon Ruler.

**The Dragon’s Tweak** is a modular strategy game for 2–4 players that blends tactical movement, resource management, and dynamic elemental combat. Each player commands a pair of dragon summoners, vying to gather powerful eggs, control the field, and ultimately challenge the mighty ruler at the heart of the realm.

- **Hex-Based Battlefield** – Build the arena from elemental hexes, each with unique effects
- **Summon and Sacrifice** – Play dragons from hand, pay with eggs or burn older allies to power stronger ones
- **Color Shifts Everything** – Battles and token pickups depend on the ever-changing elemental color wheel
- **Duels of Wits and Power** – Engage in direct confrontations where timing and color dominance decide the victor
- **Portals, Movement Boosts, and Tactical Turns** – Every tile is a potential opportunity or trap

With every turn, you'll face choices: advance toward the center or fortify your forces? Block your rival or bait them into overextending? And when the moment is right — will you strike for the throne?

**The Dragon’s Tweak** is a tense, ever-evolving contest of positioning, bluffing, and clever combos. Only the most adaptive summoner can rule the dragons.
