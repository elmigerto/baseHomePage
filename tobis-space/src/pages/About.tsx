      <p>
        I enjoy exploring new territoryâ€”both mentally and physically. Sports have
        always been a passion: from martial arts and climbing to dance, I've tried a wide range of disciplines.
      </p>
      <p>
        My analytical mindset comes from a master's degree in mechanical engineering (ETH Zurich), my structure from working as a software developer, and my creativity from painting and designing board games.
