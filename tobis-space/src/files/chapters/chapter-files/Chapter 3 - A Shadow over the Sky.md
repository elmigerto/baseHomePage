### **Chapter 3: A Shadow Over the Sky**

Flee—but where?

His breath came in short, ragged bursts. His mind raced, every direction promising danger. Back? Impossible. He didn’t even know which way the farm lay anymore. The forest pressed in on all sides, thick and oppressive. He clenched his fists. **With his luck, he’d run straight into the dragon’s mouth.**

No time to think.

To the left, the trees thinned, just slightly. Less shadow. Less suffocation. He staggered toward it, branches clawing at his face, thorns tearing at his clothes. His new tunic, barely stolen, now hung in tatters. He didn’t care. He just ran.

Then—light.

Through the trees, pale and golden, the end of the forest. He stumbled toward it, breath catching in his throat. The edge. Open land. Safety?

No.

He stopped, heart pounding in his ears. Out there, he would be exposed. Seen. Hunted. He pressed himself against a tree trunk, trying to think.

Then he heard it.

A low thunder, rhythmic and powerful. Wind surged through the trees, bending branches with a groan. The ground seemed to pulse beneath his feet.

Flapping. Wings. Massive.

His body froze as the sound grew louder. Then came the smell—intense, metallic, laced with heat and spice. It wasn’t foul, but it was suffocating. **Power. Strength. Death.**

A shadow swept over him. He dared to look.

Above, the sky darkened for a moment. A dragon soared overhead, its wings cutting through the air with impossible grace. Red scales shimmered in the sunlight, each one catching the light like polished armor. It didn’t see him—or didn’t care. It flew past, vast and beautiful, a creature born for the sky.

He couldn’t move. His legs wouldn’t listen. **His first dragon.** Real. Free. Not bound by a summoner’s will, but wild. Untouchable.

He watched as it shrank into the horizon, a speck against the vast sky, until it vanished.

Only then did he collapse.

He sat at the forest’s edge, body trembling, eyes still locked on the horizon. Slowly, he reached into his bag, pulled out a strip of meat, and chewed. The taste barely registered.

He had escaped. Again.

His thoughts drifted as he ate. These past days of flight—chaotic, exhausting—had given him time to think. He needed a future. **A life beyond running.** He would head to the city, find work. There was always work in a city, he had heard. Maybe—just maybe—he could earn enough, build a farm, find peace.

Freedom. He had dreamed of it his whole life. Never like this. Not with blood on his hands. Not alone.

After a while, he stood. The dragon was gone. The sky was quiet.

He walked.

Days blurred together—each one a test of endurance. The forest became his teacher, its lessons carved into his hands and feet. He learned to move silently, stepping where the ground gave least, avoiding the brittle snap of twigs. He read the signs of life: faint hoofprints near streams, feathers caught on low branches, the musky scent of predators marking territory.

Hunger was a constant companion, gnawing at his insides. He stripped bark for moisture, chewed bitter roots to keep his strength. Insects became meals—beetles, grubs, anything that wouldn’t kill him. Fire came slow, born of flint and dry moss, its smoke hidden under damp leaves. Nights were cold. He huddled beneath trees, wrapped in stolen cloth, listening to the forest breathe.

On the fourth day, he caught his first rabbit. It wasn’t clean—just luck and a clumsy snare—but it gave him hope. Each small success taught him more: how to read the wind, how to spot danger before it spotted him. He hid often—beneath roots, in hollows, under fallen logs—whenever he sensed eyes on him or heard unfamiliar sounds. Better to wait, to let danger pass.

Rain soaked him, thorns tore at his skin, but he pressed on, driven by the sheer need to survive. The egg in his bag remained untouched, pulsing faintly at night, a silent companion.

And then—

A hill crested. Smoke curled into the sky. Stone walls rose in the distance. The hum of life reached his ears.

The city.
