**Chapter 8: The Escape**

He had to escape.

Her face lingered in his mind—those blue eyes, her stillness, the way she had looked at him like she knew him. But now wasn’t the time. Focus. Left? Right? The halls blurred. He’d lost his bearings. Where was the exit?

A door. Unguarded.

He pushed it. Locked.

Damn.

Voices echoed down the corridor. He turned, heart racing, and moved quickly. Another door. Locked. Panic clawed at him. Were all the exits sealed at night? He hadn’t thought of that.

A window, then.

He took the stairs two at a time, reaching the second floor. As he rounded the landing, a guard appeared below—eyes sharp, face unreadable. Their gazes met. The guard narrowed his eyes.

Varan turned away, walking fast. He could feel the man’s attention, the silent realization that something was off. Footsteps behind him now—quickening.

He broke into a run. Footsteps ahead.

Trapped.

There was only one door to his right. No time to think. He pushed it open and slipped inside.

The air was warm, scented faintly of herbs and perfume. Women’s garments hung from a chair; a shawl lay draped over the bed, which was half-covered with canvas. He could hear soft breathing—a woman sleeping, just out of view.

His chest tightened. Of all rooms, why this one?

There—an open window.

He crossed the room silently, careful not to disturb a thing. One step at a time. At the window, he crouched and slipped through, letting himself fall.

The ground came fast, but he landed light, knees bending, absorbing the shock. No broken bones. Just a racing heart.

He didn’t look back. Didn’t want to imagine the woman waking to find him there. He vanished into the alley shadows and didn’t stop moving until the Fried Chicken came into view.

Inside, the inn’s owner raised a brow as Varan approached.

“You got the red crystal?” he said, voice low. “Mark won’t be happy.”

Varan handed back the servant’s clothes, sweat still clinging to his skin. “It was the only one I could find.”

The man didn’t argue. Just shook his head and turned away.

Varan climbed to his room, shut the door, and let himself collapse onto the bed. His pulse still thudded in his ears. The woman’s face came back to him—her gaze, calm and piercing. Who was she? He felt... something. A connection. Deep and inexplicable.

He wanted to see her again. Another glance. Another word.

No. That was foolish. Dangerous. He couldn’t risk it.

He lay awake for a long time, staring at the ceiling, his mind spinning with thoughts of blue eyes, stolen scrolls, and the red egg nestled in his pack. Sleep came slow—and with it, dreams of monsters, theft, and battles he couldn’t win.

Morning.

The sun barely crested the rooftops when Mark appeared at the inn, his eyes hard and unreadable. Varan stood ready, the egg hidden, the scrolls wrapped in cloth beneath his bed.

Mark’s gaze swept over him. “You didn’t find the blue one.”

Varan stayed silent.

Mark reached out, took the red crystal from him, and weighed it in his hand. Then he tossed a few coins onto the table. Far fewer than what Varan had lost.

“I need the blue one,” Mark said. His voice was calm, but there was weight behind the words. “You did the job. Not how I wanted. But it’ll do.”

Varan didn’t move. Didn’t speak. The coins stayed on the table.

Mark’s smile returned—thin and cold. “We’re heading out in an hour. Hunt in the forest. Bring your gear. You survived out there once. You’ll fight now. That’s what you are.”

He turned and left, the door creaking shut behind him.

Varan looked at the coins, then at his pack.

The red egg pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat.

A hunt. Another test. Another trap?

He didn’t know.

But the forest was calling again. And this time, he wouldn’t go unprepared.
