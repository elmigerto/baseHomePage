 **Chapter 1: The Fire in the Dark**

The forest stretched endlessly in every direction, a labyrinth of shadows and twisted branches. The night air was thick with damp earth and the distant cries of unseen creatures. His breath came ragged, each step heavier than the last. Hunger gnawed at his stomach, a dull ache that blurred the edges of his thoughts. He had been running for too long. Too long since he had last eaten, too long since he had last rested.

Then, a light.

Flickering through the trees, it cut through the darkness like a beacon. The scent of burning wood and something else—meat, roasting over an open flame—hit him like a blow to the gut. His body moved before his mind could catch up, stumbling toward it, drawn by desperation.

**No.** He froze mid-step, pulse hammering. He wasn’t alone in these woods. Someone had built that fire.

He crouched, moving carefully through the undergrowth. The closer he got, the clearer the voices became—low murmurs, the clinking of metal, the occasional burst of quiet laughter. His mouth watered. He could almost taste the food. His stomach clenched painfully, overriding the warning in his head. If he could just get close enough—just take a little—

A twig snapped underfoot.

The laughter at the campfire died instantly. A sharp whistle cut through the air. Then—a blur of motion. He ducked just as an arrow hissed past his ear, lodging deep into the tree behind him. His breath hitched.

“What was that?” one of them barked.

“Something’s out there.”

Another arrow nocked. A sword drawn. He had seconds. If he ran, they would see him. If he stayed—

“Who’s there?”

**Think.**

He straightened slowly, stepping into the fire’s glow with his hands raised. “Please,” he rasped, voice raw from days without water. “I mean no harm. I just… I need food.”

For a moment, silence. Then one of them swore under his breath. “It’s him.”

Recognition dawned in their eyes, followed by something worse. His stomach twisted. **How could I be so stupid?** The hunger had clouded his mind, led him straight into their hands. He had walked right to the very men from the farm he had fled, not recognizing their faces until it was too late. Thinking only of food, not survival. He barely had time to curse himself before he saw the slow, cruel satisfaction spread across their faces. A slow, cruel satisfaction.

“Looks like we won’t have to chase you after all.”

The nearest soldier reached for his sword, and that was all he needed. He bolted, crashing through the trees, heart slamming against his ribs. Shouts erupted behind him. Boots thundered against the earth.

He ran, but they were faster. The undergrowth snagged at his legs, the forest itself conspiring against him. A root caught his foot—he tumbled forward, hitting the ground hard, breath knocked from his lungs. He scrambled to his knees, but before he could move, the world erupted into chaos.

A monstrous roar split the night.

Then screaming.

Something crashed into the soldiers behind him. A sickening crunch. A flash of claws in the firelight. A figure—hulking, twisted, its body shifting unnaturally—ripped through them. The men barely had time to react. One was lifted into the air, his cry cut short as teeth tore through his throat. Another was flung aside like a ragdoll, his body breaking against a tree.

He lay frozen beneath the bush, too terrified to breathe. The beast was unlike anything he had seen before—its eyes gleamed with a strange, hungry light, its form flickering, as if struggling to remain in this world. The remaining soldier swung his sword wildly, but the creature moved too fast, dodging effortlessly before raking its claws across his chest. He crumpled with a strangled gasp.

Then, silence.

The beast staggered, its body heaving. Blood—its own, thick and black—spilled onto the ground. It let out a rattling breath before collapsing, motionless.

For a long time, he didn’t move. His heart pounded so hard it drowned out everything else. The stench of blood and death filled his nose. Slowly, he shifted, crawling out from his hiding place. The only survivor lay nearby, gasping, hands pressed against his bleeding chest.

He should run.

But something in him rebelled. If he let this man live, he would be hunted again. He would never be safe.

His hands trembled as he reached for the fallen soldier’s dagger. He wasn’t a killer. He had never killed someone.
—

The man’s eyes flicked to him. Weak, but aware. Hatred flickered in them, even now. His lips parted, about to call out.

He hesitated. This man had earned his death, how cruel he had been back on the farm. But now, seeing him lying there, helpless and broken—he paused. He put the dagger back. This man would die from his wounds soon anyway.

"Are you happy now?" the man croaked, his voice rough with pain. "Do you like how it ended?"

He didn’t answer. Didn’t even look at him.

The man was breathing heavily, body trembling, soaked in blood. He wanted attention, wanted words. But he had nothing left to give him. Not anymore.

He walked past, body still shaking, his limbs heavy with blood and exhaustion. Each movement felt detached, automatic. The earth dragged at him, pulling him down. It was hard to stand. The forest felt impossibly vast. He wanted to curl into the earth, disappear into the darkness. Still, he stood. Was alive.

Then he saw it.

Near the dead beast, something shimmered. Not firelight. Not metal. Something else. Something _wrong._

A stone? A crystal? A piece of the creature itself? He took a step forward—

A rustle in the trees.

His instincts screamed at him. He turned, staggering toward the nearest tree, dragging himself up into the low branches. Pain throbbed through his limbs, exhaustion pulling him under, but he couldn’t afford to sleep. Not yet.

Still, as his body sagged against the bark, his vision blurred. Darkness clawed at the edges of his mind. Just for a moment. Just to close his eyes—

The night swallowed him whole.
