**Chapter 18: - Peter’s Shadow**

Varan studied the girl across from him. She looked like a fighter—her stance steady, her expression sharp. Not rich, not polished, but real. Her bright red hair shot in every direction, giving her a rebellious edge. She watched the Serpentine Princess with quiet focus, barely glancing at Varan himself. Did she see his summon as the only threat?

His breathing was shallow. The fight hadn’t even started, but tension had already flooded his limbs. Ice—his element. Water, frozen into a weapon. That was the plan. He didn’t know the lizard’s capabilities, but he guessed fire. It felt right.

Then came the signal.

The red-scaled lizard didn’t charge recklessly. It circled, low and patient, eyes locked on the Princess, claws flexing. Searching for a weakness.

Varan stood still, trying to connect. He reached his focus inward—into the Princess. And something responded. Not like a person. Like a deep, ancient instinct. She knew combat. She _remembered_ survival. Her mind was a coil of wild discipline.

Sweat beaded on his brow.

He began to shape ice within her, preparing it beneath her scales like a coiled spring. At first, the flow resisted him. Then she yielded—subtle, silent. Agreement.

A sudden flash—the lizard fired a bolt of flame.

Varan didn’t see it in time. His focus was still inside her. The bolt struck her chest, drawing a hiss of pain. But it wasn’t the main attack. Just distraction.

The lizard was already airborne.

“Shit.”

It came down hard, claws slashing toward the Princess’s chest. From above, it had the reach. She tried to move, but the strike still landed, tearing through her scaled torso. The crowd gasped.

But Varan reacted.

With a twist of will, he froze the earth under the lizard’s landing. It wasn’t fast enough to catch its foot, but it forced the creature to land off balance. The Princess struck upward with both arms. One clawed hand was blocked—but the second struck the lizard’s jaw.

They separated.

Both wounded. Blood dripped from the Princess’s chest. Red streaked down the lizard’s face.

They circled. A heartbeat. Then the lizard roared and charged again.

Claws met claws. Strike and block. A second flame burst from the lizard’s mouth, aimed at her chest. But this time, the Princess met it with a plate of ice, formed in a blink. The fire burst against it, useless.

The fight had outpaced Varan. He stopped trying to control everything and watched. Learned.

Fire and ice took strength. There was a rhythm to it—a cooldown. Burn too fast, and you were left exposed.

The lizard dove low and bit the Princess’s arm.

Her ice defenses didn’t form fast enough. That had been its goal. Varan realized it too late.

But she didn’t flinch.

Instead of pulling free, she struck back. Her free hand clamped around the lizard’s throat, claws digging in.

The lizard didn’t let go.

She coiled her tail around its leg and yanked, dragging it to the ground. Still locked in the bite, she fell atop it. A gamble—could she crush it before it tore off her arm?

The answer came in pain.

The lizard ripped her arm free.

But the Princess didn’t scream. She used the moment to tighten her coils. Her body wrapped around the lizard, constricting it. She squeezed, forcing its arms against its sides. It thrashed, slashing at her flanks, drawing deep wounds—but she didn’t relent.

And then—

A hand grabbed Varan’s shoulder.

“Varan!” Leon’s voice. Urgent. Loud. “We have to go! Now!”

Varan blinked. He’d been lost in the fight. Everything around the ring had vanished from his awareness.

Now he saw it.

Panic.

People running. Faces pale. Screams echoing between the walls.

At one entrance, soldiers in white robes and golden shields poured in—accompanied by monstrous summons. Varan saw a wall crumble under a beast’s weight. Blades flashing. Spells fired. Chaos.

Arena fighters tried to hold the line. They were failing.

Varan turned to the other exits. Same story. Screams. Smoke. Retreat.

His eyes met the girl’s.

She had seen it too.

Without a word, they both dismissed their summons.  
Their fight no longer mattered—not in the face of a greater threat.  
Bitter enemies seconds ago, now suddenly caught in the same storm.

They stood apart, uncertain, eyes scanning the chaos, instinctively watching for danger.

Where to go? How to escape?
