### **Chapter 4: The City of Towers**

The city rose from the hill like a crown of stone and light. Surrounded by green grass fields and winding rivers, it basked in the afternoon sun, its many round towers reaching skyward. They shimmered with white stone walls and blue-tiled roofs, a sight so striking that people across the land called it the **City of Towers**. Its kingdom, too, was often named the **Blue Kingdom**, more for the architectural style than its actual name—one that few outsiders seemed to know or care to remember.

He stood on a ridge, watching. **His first city.**

Slowly, he approached. Beyond the walls sprawled a patchwork of buildings—houses and shops thrown together from stone, wood, and mud. These outer dwellings lacked the pristine white and blue elegance of the inner city. Instead, they wore shades of brown, gray, and weathered red. **Homes for those who could not afford the safety of stone walls.**

Children ran laughing through dusty alleys. Vendors shouted over the din, selling bread, cloth, trinkets. The air smelled of sweat, smoke, and spices. Beggars sat in shadowed corners, hands outstretched. Despite the life and color, **poverty was everywhere**. People wore rags like his, many thinner than they should be.

He had always had food on the farm—slaves were fed to keep them working. But this... this was freedom. And freedom came with hunger.

He stopped at a market stall. Brightly colored fruits were piled high beside warm pastries, golden and steaming.

"One pastry," he said, voice rough.

He fumbled for coins, the few he’d taken from his fallen pursuers. He didn’t know their value—slaves had no need for money—but he guessed he could survive a week or two if careful.

The pastry was soft, sweet, and flaky. **Delicious.** He savored each bite, something he’d never tasted before. Still hungry, he wandered to the next stall—a fruit seller displaying piles of strange, vividly colored produce. A green fruit caught his eye. He handed over a few coins, unsure of its worth, then bit into it without hesitation.

Sourness exploded in his mouth. His whole face twisted, eyes watering.

The vendor laughed. “First time, huh? Sour, right? They’re special. Bit of a delicacy.”

“Never tasted anything like it,” he coughed, wiping his mouth.

“You should try the red ones—Wolvesberries. Sweet, they say they help with sorrow. Maybe a lost love?”

“No thanks,” he muttered. His stomach was full. Spending more was a risk.

The vendor grinned. “Or the blue ones. Those give you strength, luck—even power, they say.”

He offered no answer, turning away. He couldn't afford to spend money without thought—every coin could mean another day of survival. His bag felt heavier. The **egg** shifted slightly as he moved, still wrapped tightly. **Best to keep it secret.** He didn’t know its value, but something told him it was dangerous knowledge.

In the market square, a massive poster caught his eye. Dragons—painted mid-battle—clashed above hooded figures performing arcane rituals. **Summoners.** He couldn’t read the letters, but the message was clear.

**Maybe someone here could help him. Help him understand the egg.**

He turned to a man passing by. “What’s this about?”

The man looked him over. “You don’t know? Summoner battles—happening near the Dragonlands. Everyone’s talking about it.”

He hesitated.

“You’re new here, aren’t you?” the man continued. “You look like a soldier who lost a fight. Tell me, any news from the other kingdoms? Don’t worry—I mean no harm.”

He tensed. His **stolen clothes** made him look the part. His **dark hair, pale skin, blue eyes**—all uncommon here—marked him as an outsider. His father’s blood, once a soldier enslaved from a distant kingdom.

**And the egg... who could he trust?** He couldn’t risk revealing it. Not yet.

“I’ve been traveling through the forest to reach this city,” he said carefully. “It’s my first time here.”

Best to say little. Too much detail invited danger.

The man nodded. “How do you like the city?”

“I love the food,” he replied honestly. “But I haven’t seen much yet. I’m looking for work. Know any place hiring?”

The man’s eyes lit up. “Sure. I’ve friends who could use help. You’ve got some strength, I see. But tell me—did you travel alone? The forest is no place for one man.”

“I was with a group of soldiers. We were moving farm goods. Bandits attacked. I was the only one who made it out.”

The man’s face sobered. “Sorry to hear. Come on, I’ll introduce you. There’s work moving goods—unloading, hauling to storehouses.”

He hesitated. **Could he trust this stranger?** Probably not. But he needed coin. **Needed to survive.**

“Carrying goods? I can do that.”

He had lifted heavier back on the farm. He wasn’t tall, but **strength wasn’t lacking**. He hadn’t expected to find work so easily.

But in this city of towers, nothing came free.
