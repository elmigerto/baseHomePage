**Chapter 9: The Summoning**

The first theft was still fresh in his mind—and in an hour, there would be his first hunt in the forest. Time moved too fast in the city. Too many new impressions, too little space to reflect.

Varan walked in circles, restless. He couldn’t stand still. His nerves had taken hold of him. What would he face out there? How would he fight? Could he kill, if it came to that? He didn’t feel ready.

Half an hour later, which felt like an eternity, Mark entered. Varan straightened. His chest tightened.

"The hunt is delayed," Mark said, voice steady and almost fatherly. "No hunt today. Rest well. We’ll go tomorrow. The color shift isn’t right for our strength."

Varan blinked. That was it? No battle? No forest?

He felt like a popped balloon, all tension escaping in a rush. Mark left as quickly as he came.

For a long moment, Varan stood still, caught between disappointment and relief. Could he rest? His body was still humming with adrenaline, reacting slower than his mind. No, he wouldn’t waste this time. He had to use it.

He rushed back through the city, barely seeing anything around him. Music played. Merchants bargained. People chatted. He noticed none of it. His thoughts spun around the scrolls. The mystery in them itched at the edge of his mind.

Back in his room, he laid out all five scrolls. Where to begin? Two were marked clearly: one with a red egg, one with a blue.

He studied the red scroll first. The creature drawn there was insect-like—four legs, two blade-shaped arms. Sharp. Spiky. Built for cutting and piercing.

The blue one showed a snake-like creature, thick-bodied, no legs, elegant. Its head was graceful, fishlike fins flaring from the sides, with two wide black eyes. It seemed made for water.

He touched the blue scroll. A faint, slick sensation, like wet glass. When he pulled his hand away, it was damp and cold. The red scroll felt warm and rough, like sunbaked stone.

He took out the blue egg. Beautiful, faintly translucent. Inside, a small creature moved—still forming, like a fetus. His breath caught.

Footsteps. Someone was approaching the door.

Panic flared. He shoved everything under the bed, checked the lock. No one could see this.

Then he noticed it: the scroll and the egg had touched, left hastily too close. A faint glow began to rise. His heart thudded.

He grabbed a pillow, tossed it over the light. The footsteps grew louder.

"Varan?" a man called through the door. One of the inn staff.

The glow brightened. A thin beam of light reached from under the bed, then moved, like a living thread, toward his chest. He backed away, but it found him.

"Varan, come down. Some lady wants to talk to you."

The light touched him. His chest glowed faintly blue. Energy surged inside him, not painful, but sharp. His skin shimmered. His breath caught.

Knocking. "Varan? You there?"

"Yes. I'll be down in a moment."

"Don’t keep her waiting."

The light faded. His heartbeat slowed. He exhaled, still shaken. A lady? Who could it be? He didn’t know anyone in this city. The thought unsettled him—was it someone from Mark's crew? Someone else who had seen too much? He opened the door.

Downstairs, a broad-shouldered woman handed him a towel. "Clean the dishes. For the clothes you borrowed. They came back dirty."

He frowned. They hadn’t been dirty. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. No use.

With a grunt, he took the towel. _Let this be the last time,_ he thought. _I’ll show them I’m not just a servant._

Hours later, back in his room, he sat again on his bed. The scroll was gone. The egg, too.

Had it entered him?

He looked down at his arms, his chest. No change. Still lean, hardened from the farm, agile but nothing special. But inside—inside he felt it. Like something glowing lived within him. A creature of blue light, coiled and watching.

He tried to focus on it, to hold it with his mind, but it slipped away—a game of catch and seek in his own soul.

He gave up. Time to try the red one.

He took out the red egg and scroll. Set them together. Nothing. No glow. He pressed the egg gently to the scroll, cradled it. The shell was warm. He could just make out the tiny creature inside, curled up like a flame in waiting.

Nothing happened.

After a dozen failed attempts, he sat back, frustrated. Maybe he wasn’t ready. Maybe it wasn’t.

He left to get food, body tired but mind still buzzing. The blue creature... he would summon it. One way or another.
