### **Chapter 5: The Trap**

He followed the man through winding streets, weaving deeper into the city's outskirts. Mark, as he called himself, greeted people along the way with cheerful nods and knowing smiles. They smiled back—not at him, but at Mark, as if congratulating him on catching prey.

The streets grew narrower, the air denser. Stone buildings loomed taller here, their walls stained by years of soot and rain. Market noise faded behind them, replaced by the scuff of footsteps and the occasional creak of wooden shutters. Shadows gathered in corners. The sunlight above felt distant.

He glanced back. A man walked several paces behind them—steady, slow. Maybe just another passerby. But his steps never faltered, never strayed. A flicker of unease sparked in his chest. Was he imagining it? Or were they being followed? He couldn’t be sure, but the feeling settled in his gut, heavy and cold.

Mark turned, walking backward a few steps, his grin wide. “I’m Mark. What about you?”

Caught off guard, he hesitated. He couldn’t give his real name—not the one the overseers used back at the farm. His mind scrambled. Then a memory—his father’s stories of a great general, a man feared across kingdoms.

“Varan,” he said. “Call me Var.”

Mark chuckled. “Var, huh? Well, come on. We’re almost there.”

He bit his lip. **Stupid.** Using the name of a foreign general, especially with his pale skin and dark hair, was a risk. Locals might mistake him for a deserter or spy. But it was too late now.

People thinned out. The outskirts of the city seemed to vanish, leaving only empty streets and fading light. He slowed, eyes scanning the alleyways, but Mark waved him on.

“Don’t worry. Just around the corner.”

He didn’t move.

Mark took a step closer. “Come on. Not much farther.”

They passed under a low archway, its stone mottled with moss and grime. On the other side, silence. No people. No noise. Just the narrow street stretching ahead, flanked by shuttered windows and broken cobblestones.

He slowed, nerves prickling. Something was wrong.

He turned. The follower was still there—not rushing, not speaking. Just watching, walking steadily forward.

Mark had stopped ahead. He stood now in the middle of the street, body relaxed but eyes sharp. The follower reached his side, and they exchanged a look. Familiar. Coordinated.

Then came the sound of footsteps—soft but distinct, echoing ahead. His heart jumped. From a side alley, a figure emerged, casual but deliberate. The man walked slowly, eyes locked on them, then took a position near the far end of the street. Not rushing. Not speaking. Just waiting.

The unease hardened into certainty. This was no coincidence.

He was trapped.

Mark’s posture shifted. He rolled his shoulders, hand sliding to the hilt of his knife.

"There’s no one here. Give us your money."

Another figure stepped into view, blocking the archway behind. A third man. His path, once clear, was now cut off. **They had planned this.**

The two in front didn’t look strong—both armed with knives, sure, but wary. Alone, he might stand a chance. But the third... if he reached them, there would be no escape.

His fingers itched for the dagger at his belt. He could fight. Might even win. But for what? A handful of coins? He shifted, feeling the **weight of the egg** in his bag. That, he would fight for. **Kill for.** But this? They were just thieves.

He took out a few coins, tossed them onto the ground.

Mark didn’t move. “All of it.”

He hesitated, then handed over the rest. His jaw clenched. Pride burned. But he was alive.

Mark counted the coins slowly. The third man reached them, his stance relaxed now, tension bleeding from the air.

“Good,” Mark said. Then, almost casually, “I wasn’t lying about the job.”

He blinked.

Mark smiled again—less sharp this time, almost amused. “As you can see, we’re robbers. You’ve got guts. Most beggars would’ve begged. You held your ground.”

He didn’t answer.

“You’ve got fight in you,” Mark continued. “Your story? About being the only survivor? I don’t buy it. You’re running. From what, I don’t care. But you need work. You need people. We could use a man like you.”

Mark held out a hand—not threatening now, but offering.

“A chance for a future, Var. Think about it. Or maybe...” He glanced briefly at the two men beside him, then back to Var, his smile thinning. “Maybe we decide you’re not worth the trouble. Maybe we leave you bleeding here in the dirt. Your choice.”

Mark looked at him with a testing glance, his smile now warm and charismatic, but his eyes sharp—measuring. He said nothing more, simply waiting for Var's choice.
