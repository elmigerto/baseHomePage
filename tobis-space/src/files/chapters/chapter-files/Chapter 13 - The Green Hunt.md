**Chapter 13: The Green Hunt**

"How long?" asked Mark.

The summoner hesitated. "Two hours for the imp, four for the wolf."

Mark nodded. "Good. That will do. The red shift will still last at least until noon."

The archer glanced at Mark, clearly displeased, but said nothing. The group moved on in silence.

There were only four of them now.

They reached a narrow river snaking through the trees.

"Let’s follow the stream," Mark said. "We might spot some green ones."

As they moved, Leon leaned in toward Varan. "It usually takes a while for a lost summon to recover—but not too long. They don’t die. Once bound to your soul, they’re permanent. You can’t remove them. And there are different strengths. Some summons take just one egg, others—more. The more it takes, the stronger they are. I don’t know how Mark figures out when color shifts happen or how long they last... maybe he buys that kind of information from the black market."

They followed the stream where the forest opened up into a shallow valley. There, the stream widened into a pond. On the far end, in the golden light of morning, five green creatures grazed. They looked like ordinary deer, but were not as slender—stockier, with thick legs and heavy bodies. Two boar-like tusks jutted from their mouths. Their black eyes glinted as they chewed, and from their mossy backs sprouted clusters of grass and creeping ivy. Twisted antlers crowned their heads like tangled branches.

One of them lifted its head and sniffed the air. It stared straight in their direction.

But it didn’t react. Not yet.

Mark turned to the summoner. "How’s the status?"

"The imp is ready. The wolf needs another hour."

"We’re not waiting," Mark said. "Varan, give me your shield and armor. You’re bait. Circle around to the far side. Get their attention and lead them this way. Once they’re chasing, we’ll pick off the last one."

The archer stepped forward. "That’s too dangerous. Let’s wait."

"No," Mark cut him off. "That flaming imp from yesterday might still be around. We’re not risking another encounter. We do this now."

The archer stared at him, lips tight, then backed off.

Mark turned to Varan. "Don’t be misled. Those deer are quick. And worse—they can manipulate the forest. Entangle you in roots and vines. Don’t get too close."

Varan took off his armor and crept through the woods, circling the clearing. He stayed low in the grass, crawling until he was opposite the others.

He paused. Watched them.

They seemed... peaceful.

One drank from the pond. Another grazed beneath a small tree. He picked up a stone. That should do it.

Then—

The closest deer turned. It stared directly at him.

Then another.

And another.

All five turned. Green eyes glowing faintly.

The one nearest him let out a strange, high-pitched roar.

The others echoed it.

Then they charged.

He hadn’t expected that.

This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.

No time.

He turned and bolted into the trees.

His heart pounded. He heard them crashing behind him—hoofbeats, branches snapping, the low roar of pursuit. His legs pumped wildly. Left—between trees. Right—through a thicket.

A scream echoed behind him—like one of the deer had been struck.

He didn’t stop.

Then—a massive tree ahead. Broad, old, knotted.

He jumped, grabbed a branch, and hauled himself up.

Upwards. Higher. Away from the trails.

He climbed quickly, pulling branch after branch. His muscles ached. His palms scraped bark. But he didn’t stop.

At last, several meters up, he paused.

Below—three green deer had surrounded the tree. A fourth emerged from the underbrush.

They stared up at him, their breath steaming, their green eyes fixed. Their gazes locked with his, unblinking, eerie in their silence. He felt the tension in their gaze, an uncanny intelligence, as though they knew exactly what he was thinking.

He thought he was safe—perched above them, heart still pounding, breath still ragged. From somewhere far behind, a sharp cry pierced the air—a deer in pain, injured. Perhaps the others had succeeded. But up here, he was alone.

Then—the tree pulsed beneath his hands.

He froze.

From the roots, thin tendrils began to grow—trailing vines, like living ropes, snaking up the trunk.

They were fast.

Too fast.

Faster than he could climb.

He scrambled higher, branches growing thinner beneath his weight. He slipped—caught himself. His breath came in ragged gasps. He was scared to fall. Scared to be caught.

There was only one choice: panic—or not.
He steadied his breath. Forced his focus. Then he summoned her, drawing on every shred of will he had left.

The serpentine princess coiled out of his chest in a shimmer of blue light, circling the tree. Her head rose, black eyes fixed on the trails approaching from below.

The vines twisted, growing faster.

They reached her.

They wrapped around her shimmering body, curling tighter and tighter, binding her to the tree. He felt her pain—sharp and cold, like something pulling against his ribs. But beneath it—calm.

She didn’t panic.

Then—the trails slowed.

Frost spread where they touched her.

Crystals bloomed along the bark.

The top of the vines exploded into glittering shards, raining silver needles onto the forest floor. For a moment, the deer didn’t move—then they backed away slowly.

There was a hateful stillness. Their glowing green eyes met the princess’s black ones in a silent challenge, refusing to break first.

Then, one by one, they turned.

The glow faded from their eyes. They slipped into the woods. Gone.

The vines around the tree stiffened, then fell away like ash.

He remained in the tree, chest heaving, limbs trembling.
