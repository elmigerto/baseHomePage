**Chapter 7: The Theft**

He stood before the building they had marked for him. In the daylight, it looked quiet. Modest for the richer district—stone walls, arched windows, a tiled roof shimmering under the sun. He paced its perimeter, eyes scanning for weaknesses. No guards patrolled outside. Only a few figures passed through the front gate, merchants mostly, wheeling carts or carrying ledgers.

How to get in? His first real theft, and he didn’t plan on dying for it.

The roof, maybe? He wasn’t a bad climber. Or he could slip in with one of the merchants. But the side door—servants, deliveries, invisible hands—that called to him. He knew how servants moved, how they dressed. He could pass for one.

He watched them, noting the plain brown tunics, aprons, and worn shoes. Then he turned away and walked briskly back to the Fried Chicken. There, he asked if they had any clothes like the servants wore. A man there, lounging near the hearth, chuckled and handed him a bundle.

"Lucky day," the man said. "Hope it stays lucky."

Back at the estate, Varan waited near the alleyway. It didn’t take long. A cart trundled down the road, pulled by a donkey and loaded with sacks. He stepped out as it approached, greeted the merchant with easy confidence, and asked about the goods.

"Decent harvest?" Varan said, lifting a sack to inspect it. "Looks like early grain. Where’d you source it?"

The merchant, eager to talk, rattled off names of villages. Varan nodded, asking a few more questions only a farmhand would know. Then the cart rolled up to the servant’s gate.

His heart beat faster.

"Let me help you unload," he said, gripping the handles of a crate.

No one stopped him. Inside the courtyard, the kitchen door swung open. A maid appeared, wiping her hands on her apron.

"More grain? Gods, we’ll drown in it."

Varan smiled. "What’s on the menu? Roast? Stew?"

"Rabbit stew, maybe. If Marta ever finds the damn herbs."

He told her a quick tale of the forest, a made-up story about wild herbs and wolves. She laughed lightly, but then he caught movement from the corner of his eye.

A guard, standing near the wall, was watching him.

Not moving. Just watching.

Varan felt a chill creep up his spine. Had he pushed too far?

He nodded to the maid, set down the crate, and slipped away through a side hall. The guard didn’t follow.

He moved fast now, heart racing. The halls here were dim, lit by narrow windows and dust-laden sunlight. He passed storerooms, staircases, and empty chambers. Then—voices ahead.

Footsteps. Two men, coming his way.

He ducked behind a hanging tapestry, breath shallow.

"...green monsters are stronger than red," the younger voice insisted.

"Foolish," the elder replied, sharp and dry. "Strength shifts randomly. One season red may dominate, the next green, then blue. The wise summoners watch carefully—and strike when their color holds sway."

"But black ones… they’re versatile. Why not just use them?"

"Because knowing when to strike is better than striking at all times. Learn that—before your first battle."

Their voices faded as they passed. Varan stepped out, pulse steadying. He followed the path they had come from, turning left into a corridor that opened into a grand hall, its marble floor catching slants of light. On the right, a door marked with a dragon sigil caught his eye.

He hesitated. Then pushed it open.

Inside: scrolls, crystals, staffs leaning against the wall, and symbols carved into the stone. And on a table near the far side, a red egg. His breath caught.

Another egg.

He stepped inside, careful not to disturb anything. The scrolls—maps, diagrams, each with colored egg symbols beside images of monstrous creatures. Instructions? Rituals? He couldn’t be sure.

He took a few, not the topmost, but ones from beneath. Then the egg—warm to the touch, lighter than expected. Mark had asked for a blue crystal. He scanned the room. Red, green, black—no blue.

A noise outside. Footsteps. Fast.

Varan snatched a red crystal, shoved it into his bag, and slipped out, heart pounding.

Only a cat stood in the hall, blinking up at him. It padded forward, purring.

"Not now," he muttered.

Dusk crept through the windows. Shadows lengthened.

He searched two more rooms. No blue crystal. Time was running out.

Behind him, footsteps again.

He moved quickly, turned left—and froze.

She stood there. Pale skin, dark hair, and eyes as blue as his own. She wore a simple dress, nothing regal, yet her bearing was noble, her presence radiant. She was beautiful—so striking it made his breath catch. His heart began to pound, a sudden rush of heat in his chest.

She stared at him, unblinking. Like she knew him.

"Hello," he said, voice unsteady.

No answer. Only those eyes, watching.

He broke the gaze, turned right into another corridor, vanishing into the dark. Her gaze stayed with him, even as he fled.

Something had changed.

He wasn’t sure what.
