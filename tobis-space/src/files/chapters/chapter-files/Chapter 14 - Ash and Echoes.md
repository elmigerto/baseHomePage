**Chapter 14: Ash and Echoes**

The climb down was harder than going up.

Every creak of the branches made Varan flinch. His hands were scraped and numb, his legs trembling—not just from effort but from everything he had seen. What he had summoned. What had nearly claimed him.

The Serpentine Princess had vanished, retreating into his chest like smoke drawn into a bottle. Yet he still felt her—coiled deep within, calm but alert. Watching. Waiting.

At the base of the tree, silver frost still clung to the bark. The vines lay limp, brittle and blackened where they had once writhed. He crouched and touched one. It cracked under his fingers like dried ash.

No sign of the deer.

But the crushed earth, the scent of torn greenery, the broken branches—they whispered where the creatures had gone. And far in the woods, he heard something limping.

He followed the sound.

The trees thinned toward a slope where light cut through the canopy. Down near the stream, he spotted movement—Leon crouched beside a large green deer, a bloodied spear in hand. Mark stood nearby, his rose-colored sword wet with sap and blood. The summoner sat against a tree trunk, robes rumpled, his expression weary.

Varan approached slowly, cautious. The air still smelled of tension.

Mark turned to him. “You made it.”

There was no praise in his voice—just the blunt observation of someone accounting pieces.

“I heard a scream,” Varan said.

“This one broke away from the herd,” Mark replied, gesturing to the fallen creature. “The rest scattered. We got lucky.”

The green deer lay still, legs curled beneath its mossy bulk. Grass and ivy still clung to its fur, now dulled by dust and blood. Its thick body rose slightly with each breath, but it was weakening fast. Near its shoulder, faintly glowing, nestled between tangled roots and fur—an egg.

A green summoner egg.

“Take it,” Mark said to the summoner. “We’ll get one, at least.”

The summoner moved forward carefully, reverent. His fingers hovered over the egg, lips murmuring something Varan couldn’t catch. The egg pulsed once, then dimmed, like it had gone to sleep.

Only the archer was missing, still out tracking the rest of the herd. Varan scanned the woods but saw no one else.

He felt the bruises on his arms, the stinging cuts across his legs. But deeper than pain, something else lingered.

The frost. The vines. The look the Serpentine Princess gave to the deer before they backed away.

There had been something there.

Something more than instinct.

He stood in the quiet, surrounded by broken branches and silence, and knew this had only been the beginning.
