### 👑 Defeat the Dragon Overlord
Works like a colored coin token – you need equal or more dragon life in the display color. Attacking not allowed in peace rounds.

### ⚔️ Fight an opponent
- ☮️ Peace round: you may not attack an opponent or enter their space. Multicolor coins cannot be collected either.
- 🎯 If an opponent blocks you and fighting is allowed:
  - Execute all permitted fight actions
  - Compare life tokens in the display color
  - Winner = player with more life
  - Tie? → Reveal new color card → second comparison
  - Still a tie? Both remain in place
  - If color or life later changes → compare again.
- 🏁 After the fight:
  - Loser = piece returns to the castle
  - Reveal a new color display card
  - Both players gain 1 life token in the display color

Draw from one of the 3 face-down dragon piles or from the face-up card piles until you have at most five cards.
- 📌 Each time you draw cards it costs 1 action (for up to 5 cards)
- Example: draw 3 cards, move the dragon, collect an egg, play a card and want to draw again → costs 2 actions in total.

### 🐉 Play cards
Pay action and egg costs with your own eggs or placed 🐲 dragons (value = egg cost).
