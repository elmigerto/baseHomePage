## üßë‚Äçüíª Agent Instructions
### Coding Style
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Functional components only
- Manage state with React Context or signals
- Apply `min-h-screen` for layout height
- Sort imports and remove unused ones
- Format using Biome on save
- It's not needed to run Biome again at the end of your work

### Routing & Pages
- Use `react-router-dom` for routing
- Subpages include:
  - `/` (home)
  - `/boardgame` with `/about`, `/community`, `/rules`, `/updates`, `/buy`
  - `/stories` and `/stories/:chapterSlug`
  - `/drawings` walk-through view
  - `/drawings/gallery` grid view
  - `/drawings/virtual` 3D room
  - `/software` and `/about`
  - `/checkout` ‚Üí address form
  - `/payment` ‚Üí Stripe redirect
  - `/success` and `/cancel` checkout result pages

### Stripe Integration
- Backend exposes `/create-checkout-session`
- Frontend redirects to Stripe Checkout
- Handle success and cancel routes
- Orders stored in `orders.db` (SQLite)
- Avoid third-party shopping platforms

## ‚úÖ Do
- Respect folder structure
- Modularize components
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability

## üö´ Don‚Äôt
- Use class components
- Introduce external UI libraries
- Include hardcoded secrets or credentials

- **Shopping Cards**: Reusable product cards with images, descriptions, and add-to-cart controls.
- **Content Sections**: Board game showcase, stories list with full texts, and a virtual drawings gallery with image modal.
- **Chapter Navigation**: Chapters load from Markdown files with matching images, ordered by number, and include previous/next links for continuous reading.
- **Stripe Checkout**: Node.js backend exposes `/create-checkout-session` and handles success/cancel redirects.
- **Deployment**: Host frontend and backend (e.g., Vercel/Render) and store Stripe secrets as environment variables.
- **Design Enhancements**: Responsive layout, default dark mode with toggle, and FontAwesome icons.
- **Internationalization**: Language dropdown with English and German strings.
- **404 Handling**: Static `404.html` page for GitHub Pages.
